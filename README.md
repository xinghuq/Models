### This repository stores the FCNN4R package— Fast Compressed Neural Networks for R developed by Grzegorz Klima.

The package was removed from R CRAN. In order to accommodate a fast implementation of DeepGenomeScan, and for convenience，I provide a 0.6.2 version of FCNN4R(FCNN4R_0.6.2.tar.gz) here.
Please download and install for your R platform. 

Install in the terminal 
``````{r}
R CMD INSTALL FCNN4R_0.6.2.tar.gz

``````
```{r}

R_LIBS=/path/to/Rlibs

```

Install from R

```{r}

devtools::install_github("xinghuq/Models/FCNN4R")

```
